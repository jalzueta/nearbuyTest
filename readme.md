#Nearbuy Technical Test

###This is the resultant App for the iOS Test for Nearbuy.

Tha App is a POI Region administrator/tester.

You can **create, edit and delete up to 15 POI Regions** (the number of POI Regions is limited because of Apple's restrictions when working with geofencing).

The **App detects when the user enters any POI Region**, and then sends a request to receive a Push Notification related with the POI Region entered.

For receiving another Push Notification for an already entered POI Region, **the user should first exit and re-enter into it**.

**This system works with the App running in foreground, with the App running in background and also when the App has been killed.**
User can **activate/deactivate the Push Notification reception** separately when the App has been sent to **background** and when the App has been **killed.**

The App shows all the configured POI Regions into a list and also in a map, entered POI Regions in green color, and exit POI in orange color.
