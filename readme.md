#Nearbuy Technical Test

###This is the resultant App for the iOS Test for Nearbuy.

Tha App is a POI region administrator.

You can **create, edit and delete up to 15 POI Regions**. Number of POI Regions is limitated because of Apple's restrictions.

**The App then will detect when the user enters any POI Region**, and then sends a request for receiving a Push Notification related with the POI Region entered.

For receiving another Push Notification for an entered POI Region, **the user should first exit and re-enter into it**.

**User can activate/deactivate the Push Notification reception** separatelly when App has been sent to **background** and when App has been **killed**.

The App shows all the configured POI Regions into a **map**, entered POI Regions in green color, and exit POI in orange.
